January 19th : 

Recipes project from The Odin Project

This project was performed to show basic utilization of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). While following the instructions listed on the website, I decided to change the structure of the webpage that seemed best fitting. Had I performed the images outside of the unordered list bullet points the pictures would of came out more random.

To showcase only HTML without utilizing CSS the images element had to be in within the list element.

Another way of differentiating from the instructions for a better UI/UX was to not use an ordered list for the steps but rather a paragraph.

Overall, this project helped me get more hands on with Git, Terminal, VSCode, GitHub, and the Odin Community when struggling.

January 25th :

Updated all HTML files to have a CSS file. Flexbox was not added to the CSS. Since by this lesson it has not been taught I refrained from adding it. I used a "*" to style most of the content then for more specific edits used a class or the element itself.
